# AI-Powered-waste-sorting-

Inspiration -
Inadequate waste sorting practices hinder recycling efforts, leading to inefficiencies and health risks for manual workers. To address this, implementing advanced waste sorting technologies like AI-powered bins or robotic systems can automate the process, improving efficiency, and accuracy, and promoting recycling for a cleaner and healthier environment.

What it does ? 
Our webcam captures pictures of waste materials and provides input to our waste sorting model. The waste sorting algorithm is trained with a large amount of dataset and it performs the operations according to the given algorithm and it sorts waste material into different categories.

How we built it ?
We built it using the PyTorch library. We used computer vision and neural network technologies.
